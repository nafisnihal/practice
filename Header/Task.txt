Task 1:
1. My bad.
2. Any kind of issue could be detected by using vs code extension like W3C Validation.
3. Doctype is a declaration of the document type by which the browser will get to know 
about the version of HTML written in the file.
4. Head is a tag that is used to contain the information about the document and define 
the head portion. Meta is an element of the head portion that defines metadata to use 
properties like keywords, character set, viewport setting, etc.
5. I used viewport in meta tag to make the webpage responsive on devices like mobile 
phones as it interacts on basis of the screen size of the device. If I don't use it, 
the webpage will visible on small screens same as the computer screen.


Task 2:
1. No, I think using the unordered list is the better way.
2. it was ridiculous. I have learned about BEM
naming convention. 
3. Label, input type, id name are must have tags to create a workable form. The name 
attribute is used to reference the submitted data.
4. Just have installed prettier but I think it isn't working properly.


Task 3:
1. Fixed it.
2. * is CSS universal selector by which everything is included. If I don't use it 
nothing will happen basically but here, I will be able to control the whole files' common styles.
3. If I don't use margin and padding 0, in output browser will show some spaces.
Margin and padding sets at 0 so there will be no space around the outside of the content.
4. Learnt about google fonts.
5. couldn't be clear.
6. Using BEM naming convention for css, codes will be structured which will be super 
effective to reuse and easy to understand and modify.
7.
